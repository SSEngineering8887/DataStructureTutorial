In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an ______ abstract data type, a structure that can map  keys to values
~
A hash table uses a ______ to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
~
Ideally, the hash function will assign each _____ to a unique bucket, 
~
In many situations, hash tables turn out to be on average ________ than search trees or any other table lookup structure. 
~
For __________ the hash function should also avoid clustering, the mapping of two or more keys to consecutive slots. 
~
Cryptographic hash functions are believed to provide good hash functions for _______ either by modulo reduction or by bit masking
~
A drawback of cryptographic hashing functions is that ____________
~
The expected constant time property of a hash table assumes that the _______ is kept below some bound.
