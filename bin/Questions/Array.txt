Some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition while other languages like ________ let the user choose the minimum value for each index.
~
Libraries provide _______ for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access.
~
Balanced trees require _____  time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log n) time,[13] whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(n)) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.
