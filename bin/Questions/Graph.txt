In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the __________  concepts from mathematics; specifically, the field of graph theory.
~
The graph data structure consists of a  _______(and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. 
~
________: tests whether there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y
~
Vertices are stored as _____, and every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices
~
A two-dimensional matrix, in which the ______ represent source vertices and _____ represent destination vertices.
~
A two-dimensional Boolean matrix, in which the rows represent the vertices and columns represent the edges is a ______
~
 ______ are generally preferred because they efficiently represent sparse graphs.
