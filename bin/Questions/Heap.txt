In computer science, a heap is a specialized _______ data structure which is essentially an almost complete _____ that satisfies the heap property: 
~
In a ______ the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. 
~
The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in _____, as a data structure for the heapsort sorting algorithm.
~
When a heap is a _______, it has a smallest possible height—a heap with N nodes and for each node a branches always has log N height.
~
As we can build a heap from an array without requiring extra memory (for the nodes, for example), heapsort can be used to sort an array _______
~
Construction of a binary (or d-ary) heap out of a given array of elements may be performed in linear time using the classic Floyd algorithm, with the worst-case number of comparisons equal to _________ (for a binary heap), where s2(N) is the sum of all digits of the binary representation of N and e2(N) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of N.
